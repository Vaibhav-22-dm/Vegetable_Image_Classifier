# Vegetable_Image_Classifier
This repository contains google colab files for a Vegetable Image Classifier

## Description -
Used a Deep Neural Network to classify images of vegetables of different types. Built a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch using Tensorflow Keras Sequential API. Improved the classification accuracy by using pre-trained networks like ResNet101 and MobileNetV2.

## Results -
| Model          | accuracy on training set | accuracy on validation set | accuracy on test set |      
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Basic CNN      | 0.9757                   | 0.9430                     | 0.9430               |
